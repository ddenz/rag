The new Kāinga Ora Address Release Policy
Published 11/10/2024
We have a new address release policy that formalises our approach to releasing customers’ address information. 

The Address Release Policy, recently endorsed by our CE Leadership Group, states that address information is to be treated as part of our customers’ personal information and can only be released when we have a lawful basis to do so, and once we have confirmed for ourselves that the lawful basis exists, including to the specific situation or request.

 

“We must take care when we’re asked about our addresses, because when we do, we are often talking about the occupant of those address too,” says Jacqualine Rean, Manager — Privacy.

 

“That means putting privacy at the heart of what we do when managing or releasing our customers’ personal information. In our Privacy Notice, we clearly state to our customers who we share their personal information with and why. This principle helps build trust with our customers and means that we are meeting our obligations under the Privacy Act 2020. Good privacy practice is simply good customer service.”

 

Even if there is a lawful basis for an address request, such as from police or emergency services, the thresholds to enable customers' information being released are high, says Jacqualine.

 

“If you’re ever in doubt, read the policy or reach out to your local Privacy Champion or the Privacy Team.”
