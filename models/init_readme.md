This folder should contain any data that is required to ensure to replicate the data science workflow. 

You may wish to further segment the data into a series of sub-folders like 'raw', 'processed' or 'final' to make the workflow process more understandable.

When it comes to machine learning the input data might change and/or become unsearchable in the future or in a worst case overwritten or deleted. 
To have reproducible/maintainable machine learning pipelines, it is crucial to keep all your raw data irreversible where possible.
Any progress you make on your raw data needs to be appropriately documented, and that is where folders come in handy. 

Data files can occasionally be quite large in size so occasionally it is more appropriate to save a smaller subset that can be used in a unit-standard test to demonstrate that the machine learning pipeline is working within expectations.
